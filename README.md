# SearchAgent-Zero
Based on Qwen3-8B and verl. Through pure RL training, it achieved state-of-the-art performance (SOTA) of 37.95 on BrowseComp-Plus, and surpassed many larger commercial models (gemini 2.5 pro; kimi-k2). 

It achieved multi-round search capability with an average of 20+ on the training set and 40+ on the test set, and could generalize well to shallow search tasks.

The process is ongoing and technical details will be updated here and on Zhihu later.
